# Final Essay: Mapping Police Violence

In today’s intensive geography world, I picked a project called Mapping Police Violence due to its relevance to the world and social climate today. The goal of this project is to provide transparency and accountability for police departments as part of the ongoing campaign to end police violence. This project was made as a response to a lack of transparency with law enforcement agencies across the country about lives these agencies have taken. Despite the Death in Custody Reporting Act in the US, an act requiring reports on people who die under law enforcement custody, there is no indication of when this information would be released to the public. The major functions are to see points on a global map with options to zoom in, and with each point clicked, a popup containing information on the victim’s name, race, age, armed status, street address of death, agency responsible for death, description , link to news articles, and whether the officer was charged with a crime. Additional features include an animation from the beginning of 2019 showing these points blinking on the date they occurred in a time-lapse fashion. Furthermore, there are additional visualizations under the map to further support one’s goal of educating oneself on matters such as structural racism and police violence. This project is targeting the general public but more importantly the public that wants to keep the police department accountable for people they have killed. It should be noted that this project is made by Samuel Sinyangwe, who is affiliated with, We The Protesters, a national organization focused on ending racism and police violence in the United States.

On a technical standpoint, the architecture of this project has a client, a backend, and relies on a variety of 3rd party services to create said information product. The client is my browser which loads the information product from the [Mapping Police Violence](https://mappingpoliceviolence.org/) website, which renders the original information product which is hosted on the platform, CARTO, which also contains the server for this project. The services include using the OpenStreetMap API and MapTiler API. The data is kept on in a PostgreSQL database using a Redis Cached metadata database with a SQL API to allow for running SQL queries against CARTO. Having a clear architecture is key in creating a sustainable long-term project.

While understanding the architecture is important, looking into the details can help provide further insight into this project. For this project, the data flow is in one direction, from the server to the client. No action on the client’s end can impact the data in the server due to the nature of the project. The type of data includes, a rendered map, data points containing information on a police killing including the victim’s name, race, age, armed status, street address of death, agency responsible for death, description , link to news articles, and whether the officer was charged with a crime. This project uses Google Tag Manager and a variety of cartodb scripts most likely rendering and connecting to third party services such as OpenStreetMap, and MapTiler as well. This is for marketing and for rendering the information in the way the creator intended it to be. The project does support responsive design. It makes sense that a strong backend architecture would be paired with a high quality responsive design in the frontend. Providing a high quality user-experience perhaps explains why the author decided to host the project on CARTO.

Below is a code snippet of am embedded maptile:

From a visual standpoint, the map appears to be made of vector layers with the points symbol as rasters. From a user experience standpoint, the map provides a smooth and intuitive experience. With limited and straight forward functionality, the map provides a welcoming experience to explore and learn about the various cases of police-violence that have happened locally, statewide, nationally, and globally. While the user-experience is important, providing the proper map and interactive functions ultimately prove key to this information product’s user experience.

This project is made of a variety of features from the basemap, thematic layers, and interactive features. The basemap is a black base color with grey lines and titles of certain geographic regions such as continents, countries, cities, and neighborhoods upon being zoomed in. The basemap is also responsive. The thematic layer would be the raster layer containing all of the points which then contain interactive feature of being able to click them to present further information on the specific incident that occurred at that point. Further interactive features include being able to zoom in, being able to search for  a location and have the map animate and zoom to the location specified, and see the occurrences / points of police violence render over time with a timeline at the bottom of the map. Further inspection of the map can be found below.
